# AI-Powered Student–Alumni Network

An AI-driven platform connecting students and alumni to foster mentorship, academic support, and cross-faculty collaboration. This repository currently contains all planning and documentation for the project, including functional specifications, technical design, and UI/UX mockups.

## 🚀 Project Status
The project is currently in the **implementation phase**. 

## ✨ Features (Planned)
- **AI-Smart Matching:** Intelligent profile matching between students and alumni.
- **Academic Support:** Workflows for resource sharing and study assistance.
- **Secure Communication:** Real-time messaging and chat rooms.
- **Cross-Faculty Tools:** Collaboration features for interdisciplinary projects.
- **Role-Based Access:** Managed access for Students, Alumni, and Admins.

## 📚 Documentation
Detailed project documentation is available in the `docs/` folder:
- 📄 [Technical Specifications](docs/FBN7YM_TECHNICAL_SPECS.pdf)
- 📋 [Functional Specifications](docs/FBNY7YM_Functional_Specs.pdf)

## 🏗️ Architecture & Folder Structure

This project implements **Clean Architecture** (Hexagonal Architecture) to ensure a strict separation of concerns. This design keeps core business logic independent of frameworks, databases, and UI.

## 🛰️ Unidirectional Dependency Flow

To maintain a **decoupled codebase**, dependencies only point inwards:

    Presentation (Controllers) receives the request and triggers a Use Case.

    Application (Use Cases) executes logic using Domain entities.

    Infrastructure (Prisma/Cohere) handles technical implementation of the interfaces defined in the Domain.

    Note: The structure above highlights the backend organization specifically to demonstrate the system design implementation.
